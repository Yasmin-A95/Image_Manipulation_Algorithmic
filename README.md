# Algorithmic Image Manipulation

## Please steal this code!

- Clone the repo
- Run `npm i` in your terminal
- Add your own `assets` folder and images 
- Alter the following line of code in `scrips.js` (at the time of writing this is line 4)
```js
loadImage('./assets/house0.JPG').then((image) => {
```
- Just to be super clear ... 
```js
('./assets/your_file_name_goes_here')
```
- Lastly the following command from your terminal `node scripts.js`
- You should get this prompt `The JPG file was created.`
- And have an image named `done.jpg` in your assets folder! Run `open .` in terminal for easy access.
